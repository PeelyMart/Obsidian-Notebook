## Service Desk: Philosophies

### Philosphy 1: Automate as much as possible
- You will always be outnumbered by the amount of tasks needed to be done: Automate
    - Regular Backups
    - Systems data collection
    - User account maintenance 

### Philosophy 2: Delegate tasks if simple enough
- Use escalation and assign task to approrpiate co-workers 
- Pass Information, Define responsibilities
- Handle user-interruption

### Philosphy 3:

### Philosphy 4: Communicate as much as possible
- Avoid confusion among users
- Use efficient Communication channels
- Not only fellow IT but the rest of the organization


### Philosphy 6: Security Cannot be an afterthought
- Threats come in different forms
- A systems admin must be aware of security implications 
- Not deeply but knowledgeable enough

### Philosphy 7: Plan ahead but be open to the unexpected
- System admins need to be aware of what's going on in the organization to be able to prepare for future work. 
- Anticipate problems before they occur and make neessary preparations ahead of time, so that you can respond quickly if issues come up 
    - Spare parts

- Off -> refers to a machien that has been retired and powered off

# Workstations
- Computer hardwre deidcated to a single customer's work 
- Usually deployed in large quantities w/ long lifecycles 
- OS instllation 
    - Full/partial/cloning
- Network Config
- System Update

# Deeper Dive Datacenters
- A central location where all IT equipment and structured cables are housed
- It can be in many orms but will always have 
    - Cable management
    - Flooring 
    - Cooling 
    - Equipment rack
    - Power 

#### Raise Flooring 
- Makes space for underground cables
- Steel structure that needs to carry the weight of the rack
- Modular and can be opened

#### Cooling 
- To cool the rack temperature control

#### Power redundancy
- Power during outages 

#### security
- Authorized entry
- Protection from natural / not-human incidents
