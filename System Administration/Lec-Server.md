#### Servers are ***qualitatively*** different from workstations
- It has different features engineered to different price points
	- 
- special features that aid in support and installation

#### Typically have maintenance contracts and backups
- Servers have a standard of 5 years tech refresh
	- Servers serve the public -> big attack area constant refresh to patch vulnerabilities
	- 24/7 SLA --> Service level agreement 

#### Enhancing reliability with servers 
- Server appliance 
- Redundant power supplies
- Full vs n+1 redundancy
- Hot swap components
	- Modular components
- Centrailized management
- Multiple network components

#### Server processors
- More cache memory
- move more data at a time -> bigger word size
- multipl cpu setups 
- ECCC memory
	- Error correcting -> ensures data integrity -> accurate data 
Intel -> Xeon D, W, E
AMD -> EPYC

Other strategies
- Blade -> one application - one server
- Virtual -> many apps - one server 

#### Form factors 
- Tower servers
	- Looks like desktop
	- Advantage
		- Better cooling since not desnely packed
		- Can use standard components
	- Disadvantage 
		- bulky
- Rack-mounted
	- Can be inside a rack
	- may be hotter
	- special size components
	- 1 or 2 U size
		- 2U has better airflow 
		- 
- Blade
	- Data storage
	- Modular design chassis 
	- Each server inside chassis is one entity 
		- each slots is one server that acts on its own 
	- Advantage
		- space saving 
		- Less cables 
		- Less total consumption 
		- More CPU in less space 
	- Disadvantage 
		- Only blades and components can be installed from the same manufacture
